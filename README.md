# Flat Store

**Flat Store** is an open-source Flatpak repository and application hub built on the principles of mutual respect, progress, and accessibility. We believe that the future of software development is inclusive, and our goal is to provide a home for creators who have been pushed away by toxic gatekeeping.

## 🌟 Our Philosophy
In many modern repositories, developers face hostility and elitism. **Flat Store** is different. We focus on the quality and safety of the software, not on judging the person or the tools they use to create it.

## 🛡️ Core Principles

### 1. Zero Tolerance for Toxicity
Moderation should be a service, not a power trip. We strictly prohibit condescending language, personal attacks, or labeling contributors' work with derogatory terms. Every contributor, from novice to expert, is treated with dignity.

### 2. AI-Friendly & Future-Proof
We embrace the future. If your code is generated or assisted by AI, it is **welcome** here. We judge software by its functionality, performance, and security—not by whether a human or an AI wrote the lines. AI is a powerful tool that democratizes development, and we support its use.

### 3. Support over Judgment
Mistakes in manifests or submission forms are part of the learning process. Instead of accusing developers of "lying" or being "lazy," our community aims to provide constructive feedback and guidance to help get your app published.

### 4. Security & Transparency
While we are open and welcoming, we do not compromise on safety. All submissions undergo transparent checks to ensure they are safe for end-users and respect their privacy.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To submit your application to **Flat Store**, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Switch to the `pull-request` branch** in your fork. This branch is intentionally empty to provide you with a clean start.
3. **Add your manifest file** (e.g., `com.example.app.json`).
4. **Open a Pull Request** from your fork's `pull-request`.
5. **Format the PR Title** as: `Add <Flatpak ID>` (Example: `Add site.ikhlasulov.openrpm`).
6. **Fill out the template** that appears in the description field.

> **Note:** If you are new to Flatpak or GitHub, don't worry! If your build fails or you make a mistake in the manifest, our team will help you fix it. We value your contribution.
