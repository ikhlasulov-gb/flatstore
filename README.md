# Flat Store 🚀

**Flat Store** is an open-source Flatpak repository and application hub built on the principles of mutual respect, progress, and accessibility. We believe that the future of software development is inclusive, and our goal is to provide a home for creators who have been pushed away by toxic gatekeeping.

## 🌟 Our Philosophy
In many modern repositories, developers face hostility and elitism. **Flat Store** is different. We focus on the quality and safety of the software, not on judging the person or the tools they use to create it.

## 🛡️ Core Principles

### 1. Zero Tolerance for Toxicity
Moderation should be a service, not a power trip. We strictly prohibit condescending language, personal attacks, or labeling contributors' work with derogatory terms. Every contributor, from novice to expert, is treated with dignity.

### 2. AI-Friendly & Future-Proof
We embrace the future. If your code is generated or assisted by AI, it is **welcome** here. We judge software by its functionality, performance, and security—not by whether a human or an AI wrote the lines. AI is a powerful tool that democratizes development, and we support its use.

### 3. Support over Judgment
Mistakes in manifests or submission forms are part of the learning process. Instead of accusing developers of "lying" or being "lazy," our community aims to provide constructive feedback and guidance to help get your app published.

### 4. Security & Transparency
While we are open and welcoming, we do not compromise on safety. All submissions undergo transparent checks to ensure they are safe for end-users and respect their privacy.

## 🤝 Join the Movement
If you are a developer who is tired of the "gatekeeper culture," or if you have a project that was rejected elsewhere for arbitrary reasons—**you have a place here.**

* **For Developers:** Submit your manifests without fear of being insulted.
* **Для Maintainers:** Help us build a healthy ecosystem based on mentorship, not authority.
